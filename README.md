# Feature 1: Symptoms Checklist
Made by: Adam Adamson
Description: A visitor will browse to a "symptom checker" page which essentially has a list of symptoms.  Based on the amount of check boxes they click, our application will determine whether or not they actually need to come in for a test.  If the value of checkboxes is greater than X, the application redirects them to the next feature.

# Feature 2: Patient Onboarding
Made by: Micahel Maddaloni
Description: Patient onboarding. This will require personal data like a name, email address, etc., which will also be used to sign them up for the website.

# Feature 3: Calendar
Made by: Ryan Melink
Description: Calendar feature. On a separate page we will have an event schedular for selecting the time slots that are available to the user.  This will be both an independent feature (i.e., any visitor can browse to it and check for open times) as well as being tied into the onboarding feature.
